Features Implemented:
- Report page: Tracks and details the user's moods logged on current month calendar. A pie chart displays slices representing percentages of moods reported, and the report includes a count of each mood.
- Grow Plant: Users can grow their personal plants by logging an entry each day. If users have a streak of 2 or more days, their growth rate is increased. After reaching 100%, a new plant will automatically be unlocked. Users can switch between unlocked plants and have the option to reset their current plant growth. After unlocking plants, users will earn a badge, which will be shown on their account page. If users do not log an entry for more than 7 days, their active plant will "wilt" and reset to the beginning of its current growth stage. Once logging an entry after it's been wilted, the plant will regain its color.
- Journaling : When users log an entry, their past entries will be available to read. Users can edit their entry if it is the same day they logged it.
- Account : Users have access to their account details and can change their username and password. Account will display badges as a sign of achievement to plants that have been unlocked.

Changes made from Sprint 1 that have been implemented:
- Organized classes into packages.
- Fixed bug with overlapping emotions in Water Your Plant page. All emotions in water your plant page is different and labeled to make it clearly identifiable.
- Fixed bug where entry is not saved after being logged. After starting an entry and saving, users can come back to their entry from today and edit it or continue where they left off.
- Added a log out button to the account page so users can log out now.

Where to find content sharing:
Content sharing can be found on the account page. Users can share their achievements/badges unlocked and our app, BloomMoods. Upon clicking the Google Drive link, the APK for BloomMoods can be downloaded.
